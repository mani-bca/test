"Today I'm presenting a custom GitHub Action I've developed that automatically lints our JavaScript code
on pull requests. This solution integrates directly into our existing workflow and provides real-time
feedback without requiring developers to remember to run linting locally."


We've all experienced PRs with inconsistent code styles or basic issues that should have been caught
earlier. This tool ensures we maintain our coding standards by automatically checking every PR, providing
immediate feedback to developers before reviewers need to look at the code."


"Our solution is a custom Docker-based GitHub Action that runs ESLint on JavaScript files changed in a
pull request. It creates annotations directly in the GitHub interface, making issues immediately visible
without leaving the PR view."


"The action runs in a Docker container that provides a consistent environment. Our custom script identifies
changed files in the PR, runs ESLint on them, and converts ESLint output into GitHub annotations. The
entire process takes seconds and integrates seamlessly with our workflow."

"Let me show you the action in practice. Here's a sample PR where I've intentionally introduced some
linting issues. You can see the action runs automatically and places annotations directly on the problematic
lines, distinguishing between errors and warnings based on our ESLint config."

"This solution provides several benefits: developers get immediate feedback without waiting for manual
review, our code style remains consistent, and reviewers can focus on logic and architecture instead of style
issues. And because it uses our ESLint config, it enforces the standards we've already agreed upon as a
team.

"Implementation is straightforward. We'll add the action files to our repository, create a workflow file that
triggers on pull requests, and ensure our ESLint configuration reflects our team's standards. The action can
be live in our repository within an hour."
